# Terminal Pacman ðŸŸ¡

A terminal-based implementation of the classic Pacman arcade game using ASCII graphics and ANSI escape sequences.

## Overview

This project recreates the Pacman experience in the terminal, featuring authentic ghost AI behaviors, smooth rendering, and all the classic game mechanics. Built with Python, it demonstrates advanced terminal manipulation techniques and clean game architecture.

## Technical Scope

- **Rendering Engine**: Custom ANSI-based renderer with double-buffering
- **Game Logic**: Complete Pacman rules, scoring, and level progression  
- **Ghost AI**: Faithful recreation of Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde behaviors
- **Input System**: Non-blocking keyboard controls
- **Performance**: Optimized for smooth terminal gameplay

## Architecture

```
Game Engine â”€â”€â–º Renderer â”€â”€â–º Terminal
     â”‚
State Manager
     â”‚
Game Objects / AI System / Input Handler
```

The modular design separates game logic from rendering and I/O, making the codebase easy to understand and extend.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Terminal with ANSI escape sequence support
- 80x24 character window minimum

## Development Status

ðŸš§ **Under Active Development**

- [x] Core rendering engine
- [x] Maze system
- [ ] Player controls and collision
- [ ] Ghost AI implementation
- [ ] Scoring and power-ups
- [ ] Sound effects and polish
